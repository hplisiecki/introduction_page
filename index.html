        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="/introduction_page/img006-1.png" alt="Profile picture" id="profile-picture">
        <p>I am a dedicated computational social scientist, currently undertaking a PhD at the intersection of psychology and machine learning. My deep-rooted interest lies in the exploration of the human mind, utilizing the power of human language as a medium. I harness the capabilities of natural language processing techniques to decipher the intricacies of our thoughts and emotions.
            <br><br>
            Beyond the realm of psychology, my research extends into the fields of computational sociology, politology, and meta-science, painting a comprehensive picture of social dynamics through the lens of data and algorithms. I am a firm believer in the principles of Open Science, currently creating a Polish Society of people who share these tenets.
            <br><br>
            Technically, I am captivated by the transformative potential of machine learning. It fascinates me how this tool can extract meaning, patterns, and insights that would be impossible for the human mind alone to discern, truly exemplifying the magic of our modern era.
            <br><br>
            I envisage a future where the advancements in information theory blur the traditional boundaries of research methodology. A future where it's indistinguishable whether studies are qualitative or quantitative. It's this future that I strive towards in my work, continuously pushing the envelope in my pursuit of knowledge.

            And yes, this introduction was redacted by an LLM.
